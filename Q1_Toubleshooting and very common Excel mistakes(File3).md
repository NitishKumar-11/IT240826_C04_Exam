# What are some common mistakes in the Excel spreadsheet and Troubleshoot?

## I searched about it and found some common mistakes or errors such as:

+ #####	-Can't display value	Your column is too narrow to display the output.
+ CALC!	-Error in calculation	Excel doesn't know how to calculate the formula.
+ DIV/0!	-Division by zero	Your formula is attempting to divide by zero.
+ N/A	-Not available	The value you searched for is not available.
+ NAME!	-Formula name error	Excel doesn't recognize the name of the function you entered.
+ NULL!	-"Null" overlap	You requested the result of overlapping ranges (most likely a typo)
+ NUM!	-Invalid number	The number is too large or too small to be displayed in Excel.
+ REF!	-Invalid reference	A reference was deleted after creating the formula.
+ SPILL!	-Spill area	The output area already contains a value.
+ VALUE!	-Invalid value	An unexpected value was entered somewhere in the formula.
