# What questions i should ask to a client who is unsure how to change into Dark mode?

+  Are you using the latest update of the Windows 11?
+  You want to use the dark mode for all the applications or any particular app.?
+  Have you attempted to change the mode before?
+  what did you attempt to change the mode?
+  Have you faced any issues on the screen such as flickering or like that?

*To be honest i could not be able to find the exact questions on any site. So i did alot of research about what i should ask the user to understand the problem.*

*I mentioned some sites link where i did research that what question i can ask.
